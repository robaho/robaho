All work below is 100% original and not affilated with any employer past or present.

_<sup>***</sup>For those that wonder, robaho is read as `rob ahoy` which is a legacy from my college days when a close friend and I would great each other yelling across the quad. He was `marcaho`. The avitar is Bogey - the greatest dog that ever lived._ 

## FinTech work

_The projects are created with a "performance first" design. Although they're not "feature complete", they can easily form the base of production grade applications - and several have. Their primary purpose is to be easily digestible educational "blueprints"._
